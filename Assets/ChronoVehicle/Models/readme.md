Ensure all the directorys are structured in the same way as the main Chrono repository data directory as ChronoUnity will search for the data files here (unless altered in UChSystem.cs)

The collision objects, and any other hard-coded data paths for chrono resources can be found in the streamingassets folder. Again, they must be in the same structures as the chrono repository
